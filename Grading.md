Criteria:

- resource allocation is automated
- resource allocation is reproducible
- component bootstrapping is automated -> Microk8s.yml
- component bootstrapping is reproducible -> Microk8s.yml
- every component exists and is operational
- every component can be reached via HTTPS
- FQDNs are configured for all components, resolve to each of them and serve them properly
- application runs with a replication factor of 2 -> Application runs as ReplicationSet with replicas set to two
- in each environment the applications uses a different instances of its backing service (database)
- CI/CD pipeline functions properly -> finishes without error
- CI/CD pipeline is triggered through VCS commit, or manually, in case of production environment -> triggers everytime a commmit is done
- CI/CD pipeline consists of at least 3 stages -> build, test, deploy stages
- overall setup implements all environments
- concept matches implementation
- implementation meets all formal requirements
- at least one component - aside from the application - was bootstrapped by yourself -> Kubernetes via MicroK8s
- submitted a Pull Request, that adds another meaningful test to the application
- [3] quality and impression, e.g.:
- reasonable documentation
- readable commit messages
- engagement
