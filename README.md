- version control: Gitlab
- pipeline: Gitlab Ci
- container: Docker
- container orchestrator: Kubernetes/Vagrant with Kubespray
- local everything
- complete infrastructure start script/option

- Install Vagrant ✓
- Install docker ✓  
- Run application locally with dependencies ✓
- Create dockerfile for the application: one application server/client, make sure it runs
- Find a docker image MongoDB ✓
- Find a docker image for local Gitlab ✓
- Check the application code into local Gitlab
- Create with Gitlab CI (Build/Test/Deploy) a image and let it run on a container
- Create gitlab-ci.yml (build/test/deploy when new version) 
- Install kubespray
- Configure kubespray to fetch container
- Configure kubespray to port forward
